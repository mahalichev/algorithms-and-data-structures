## ðŸ“˜ Brackets analyzer
Brackets analyzer is a program that recursively checks the correctness of the bracket sequence specified by the formulas:
```
brackets ::= A | bracket brackets
bracket ::= (B brackets)
```
As a result of the program's execution, for example, when entering an "expression", the following message will be displayed:
```
expression - THIS IS A BRACKETS
-or-
expression - THIS IS NOT A BRACKETS
```
The program supports command line and file input and provides instructions for its use.

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:
```
make
./a.out
```
The program supports testing. To run the tests, place the necessary tests in the `Tests/ToCheck` directory, and place the correct answers to these tests in `Tests/Answers`.

To run the tests use `./a.out test`

Directory: `./brackets-analyzer`
